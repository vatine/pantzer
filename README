This is alpha-level software. To load (and play):
Start a lisp
Load pantzer.asd
Ask ASDF to load the system "pantzer" (this should suck CLX in).
Run NET.HEXAPODIA.PANTZER:UI-LOOP

You steer by shifting the mouse pointer left or right.
You fire with button-1 and exit with button-3.

At the moment, there is no "change speed" implemented (might,
possibly, come in the future).
